/*
Sometimes we've getting a problem with the variable type, I mean if we were performing a mathematical calculations with two variable but, one variable was a number and the other one was string, in that type of situation, we will be using a 'typeof' keyword in the debugging pahase to recognize and solve the problem.

Task:
Add two console.log() statements to check the typeof each of the two variables seven and three in the code.
let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
*/

let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
console.log(typeof seven);
console.log(typeof three);
