/*
During looking for bugs, we have to take care for misspelling, because JavaScript is case sensitive in the names of variables and the functions. 

Task:
Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the netWorkingCapital calculation works.
let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = recievables - payable;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);

let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);
